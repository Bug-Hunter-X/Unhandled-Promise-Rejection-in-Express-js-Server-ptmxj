# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Server

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js Express.js applications: improper handling of promise rejections within asynchronous operations.  The server may fail silently or produce unexpected behavior without robust error handling, potentially causing crashes or inconsistencies.

## Bug Description:

The provided `bug.js` file showcases an Express.js server with an asynchronous operation (`someAsyncOperation`). This operation can simulate a network error. The current error handling is insufficient, resulting in a lack of informative logging, and most importantly, no proper response sent back to the client upon failure. This lack of error handling can lead to a poor user experience and difficulty in debugging issues.

## Solution:

The `bugSolution.js` file presents a corrected version with improved error handling.  The solution includes comprehensive error logging and sends appropriate error responses to the client, enhancing the application's reliability and maintainability.

## How to Reproduce:

1. Clone the repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `node bug.js` to see the bug in action. Observe the console output and test the API endpoint in your browser or a tool like Postman.  The server might sometimes fail silently, sometimes log an error to the console but still respond, or crash entirely.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the improved version. Observe the response in case of failure; a meaningful error message should be provided to the client, and comprehensive error logging is present in the console.
